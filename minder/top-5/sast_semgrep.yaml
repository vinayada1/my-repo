description: |
  Verifies that static application security testing (SAST) is configured for
  the repository using Semgrep or CodeQL.

  Semgrep is a static analysis tool that can be used to find security
  vulnerabilities in code. It is a fast and lightweight open-source tool that
  can be integrated into the pull request workflow to highlight dangerous code
  patterns which might introduce a vulnerability.

  This rule configures Semgrep in the open-source "community edition" mode. For
  more information, including commercial integrations, see
  [semgrep.dev](https://semgrep.dev/).
guidance: |
  Ensure that Static Application Security Testing is configured and enabled for
  the repository.  This rule checks for Semgrep actions with a pull_request
  trigger.
